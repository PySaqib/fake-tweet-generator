## Fake Tweet Generator

Fake Tweet Generator is an online tool developed using basic HTML, CSS & Angular JS along with some jquery.
<br/><br/>
You can use the tool by filling out the details and a tweet will be generated. Currently, the tool only has dark theme but I hope to add light theme soon. Along that, I will be adding a feature to remove verification. I'm too lazy to add it right now.

### How to use the tool?

Just fill out the details in the form. For profile picture, go to Google or Twitter to search the image. Right-click and select "Copy Image Address". Insert that address into the Profile Picture URL and the image will be automatically retrieved. <b>Square pictures work well.</b>
